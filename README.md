## Git Branching Naming

Each branch has its default name, we must set the prefix name as the default name in order to recognize which type of branch are we working in. Example:

**Correct Naming** :ok_hand:

``` feature/cap1-mime-type  ``` 

**Incorrect Naming** :-1:

``` cap1-mime-type  ``` 

### Kebab-case names

When a web browser accesses a root folder, they'll only read camel cases or kebab cases folders to link a path. Otherwise, an error will occur. Example:

**Correct Naming** :ok_hand:

``` feature/cap1-mime-type  ``` 

**Incorrect Naming** :-1:

``` cap1_mime_type  ```
